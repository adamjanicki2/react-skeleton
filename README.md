## Description

A super simple template repo for static React projects.

## Action items

1. Clone this repo, or use the "Use this template" button to create a new repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
5. **Important**: in your editor, globally search for `skeleton` and replace with your project name and info everywhere. This is especially important for any `.json` files where I couldn't add any `TODO` comments. _Pay specific attention to the `package.json`, which contains info for deploying to Github Pages_
6. Start building your app!
